# Reds-Hackathon-2024
The code for our submission to the Cincinnati Red's 2024 Hackathon. There is both an R Script and a Python Notebook File. Our team was made of up people proficient in both, so the code is between the two. 
The Python script contains the majority of the feature engineering and all of the machine learning modules implemented. The R Script holds the creation of our usage categories as well the the performance linear regression models.
